= BUILDING =

To build `queens', run:

    make

This will construct the executable and ensure that runTrials.sh has the correct permissions.

= USAGE =

The default behavior will perform a hill-climbing search of the N-queens
problem and output the resultant board and the number of attacking
queens. Full usage instructions for `queens' are as below. You can also
get usage instructions by running `queens -?'.

    queens [-rcq?] [-d N]
        -r      Use random restarts to find solution
        -c      If using random restarts, print number of
                restarts required to reach target
        -q      Suppress printing the board and number of
                attacking queens
        -d N	Sets the board dimension and number of
                queens to N (Default = 8)
        -?	    Print this usage message


Note that queens is fairly stupid in its options checking, so please
only feed it integers when using the -d option. Also note that board
sizes over ~20 have the potential to run for quite awhile.

= RUNNING TRIALS =

The bash script runTrials.sh will run `queens' 100 times without
restarts and 50 times with restarts and report the number of plateaux
hit in the first case and the number of restarts required on average in
the second case.
