To build `queens', run:

    make

= USAGE =

The default behavior will perform a hill-climbing search of the N-queens
problem and output the resultant board and the number of attacking
queens. Full usage instructions for `queens' are as below. You can also
get usage instructions by running `queens -?'.

    queens [-rcq?] [-d N]
        -r      Use random restarts to find solution
        -c      If using random restarts, print number of
                restarts required to reach target
        -q      Suppress printing the board and number of
                attacking queens
        -d N	Sets the board dimension and number of
                queens to N (Default = 8)
        -?	    Print this usage message


Note that queens is fairly stupid in its options checking, so please
only feed it integers when using the -d option. Also note that board
sizes over ~20 have the potential to run for quite awhile.
